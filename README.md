# Workshop 6: Text and language

## URL:
https://noon0v0.github.io/Workshop-task-6/


## Tasks:

- Create an interactive nonsense poem generator using the rita.js library.
- Use at least three different functions from the rita.js library to process the user's input.

## Note:

- The `write_poem()` function displays the lines of the poem on the canvas.
- The `new_line()`function is triggered when the button is pressed. It processes the user input text and generates a new line for the poem using one of three methods:
  - Replace a word in the input line with a rhyming word (if available). (function `rhymesSync(word)`)
  - Replace nouns in the input line with words that sound similar. (function `soundsLike(word)`)
  - Replace each word in the input line with a randomly chosen word. (function `randomWord()`)

## Project:

The sixth task of the workshop accomplished a poetry generator that processes user-inputted sentences in three random ways. The first method substitutes words based on rhyming, the second method replaces nouns with words that sound similar, and the third method randomly replaces each word.
